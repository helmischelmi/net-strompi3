# net-strompi3
A very basic start to read the status of StromPi3 (Firmware-Version 1.72 required) (from joy-it) by .Net Core 3.

Imitates python-script 'StromPi3_Status.py' provided by joy-it (https://strompi.joy-it.net/downloads/)

Output:
https://github.com/helmischelmi/net-strompi3/blob/master/rpi_StromPi3_Status.png

Attention: Publishxx.bat runs on post-build, to transfer files to the raspi.
Adopt publishxx.bat according to your needs or use WinSCP to transfer the files.
